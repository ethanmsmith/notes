# Time Management

## What not to do
The speaker started off telling us that saving a bits of time throghout the day is __not__ the way to do it.  
She gave the example "If you DVR your shows and skip through commercials, you save 8 minutes per 30 minutes of watching TV. After 2 hours of TV, you have 36 minutes of extra time!!1!". 
    This is **NOT** the way to do it.

## What to do
**Make time for your priorities**  
A 'counter' example she gave was "We build the lives we want and time saves itself." This is a better quote to believe.  


### Broken water heater example: 
- **Who?** Mother of 3 children who rus her own business and constantly running arpund. She works 50hr weeks + 3 kids. Not very much free time
- **What?** This mother is running around constantly to taxi around her children, run her business, and stay healthy. Very little time to spare.  
 
  Enter BROKEN WATER HEATER, carpeted basement

- This woman has to stop everything and get heating professionals in the next day to repair the water heater and then carpet cleaners in the next day to professionally clean the carpets and clean up any mildew, mold, etc. She spends 8 hours of her week handling this repair.
## Keys to Time Management
   - Keep your priorities as #0. **Make time for your priorities!!!**
     - Every minute, everything I do is *my* choice. "I don't have time" means "Its not my priority." In other words, "I don't want to do it."
   - Treat priorities like the "broken hot water heater"
   - Give yourself a performance review for your professional career
     - Choose 3-5 things you want to be on your review for the end of the calendar year. Then after choosing those items, break them down into smaller, manageable goals.
   - Write next years family christmas card
     - Think of a family christmas card. The purpose of it is to tell family and those that you care about what you have done in the past year. 
     - Choose 3-5 items that you want to be in your family christmas card. After choosing, then you break them down into manageable goals
     - After the performance review and christmas letter, you have 6-10 goals with manageable steps to achieve them.
   - Weekly to-do list of goals
     - The best time for that is Friday afternoons (any slow afternoon, really..) to plan the next week. Spend 1 hour on Friday afternoon to break down three categories for the next week.
        - Self
        - Relationship(s) - Romantic (Emalee <3) and friendships
        - Career

## Closing Note
Look at the whole of one's life and see where the good stuff can go. Find what matters and make the time for it!
