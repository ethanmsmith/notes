# Time Management

## What not to do
The speaker started off telling us that saving a bits of time throghout the day is __not__ the way to do it.  
She gave the example "If you DVR your shows and skip through commercials, you save 8 minutes per 30 minutes of watching TV. After 2 hours of TV, you have 36 minutes of extra time!!1!". 
    This is **NOT** the way to do it.

## What to do
A 'counter' example she gave was "We build the lives we want and time saves itself." This is a better quote to believe.

## Keys to Time Management
   - Keep your priorities as #0. Make time for your priorities!!!
     - Every minute, everything I do is my choice. "I don't have time" means "Its not my priority." In other words, "I don't want to do it."
   - Broken water heater example: 
     - **Who?** Mother of 3 children who rus her own business and constantly running arpund. She works 50hr weeks + 3 kids. Not very much free time
     - **What?** This mother is running around constantly to taxi around her children, run her business, and stay healthy. Very little time to spare.
     - Enter BROKEN WATER HEATER, carpeted basement
     - This woman has to stop everything and get heating professionals in the next day to repair the water heater and then carpet cleaners in the next day to professionally clean the carpets and clean up any mildew, mold, etc. She spends 8 hours of her week handling this repair.
   - Keep priorities like the broken water heater problem
